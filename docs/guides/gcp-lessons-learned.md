# GCP Deployment Lessons Learned

## Date: October 28, 2025

### Incident: GKE Authentication Failure During Automated Deployment

---

## Summary

The first automated GCP deployment using `python3 setup.py --cloud-provider gcp` failed at the Helm deployment phase due to a missing critical dependency: **gke-gcloud-auth-plugin**. While Terraform successfully deployed all GCP infrastructure (VPC, GKE cluster, Cloud SQL, etc.), the script could not configure kubectl to access the cluster, preventing the n8n Helm chart from being deployed.

---

## Background

### What Happened

1. ✅ **Phase 1 (Terraform)** completed successfully:
   - VPC network created
   - GKE cluster deployed (n8n-gke-cluster, Kubernetes 1.33.5)
   - Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance created
   - Service accounts and IAM configured
   - Secret Manager secrets stored
   - Total: 26 resources created

2. ❌ **Phase 2 (Helm deployment)** failed:
   - `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` command failed
   - kubectl could not authenticate to GKE
   - n8n namespace was never created
   - No Helm releases deployed
   - Script exited without clear error messaging

### Root Cause

**Missing dependency**: `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`

**Why it failed:**
- GKE clusters running Kubernetes 1.25+ require the `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` for kubectl authentication
- The plugin replaces the deprecated built-in kubectl GKE auth provider
- Without the plugin, `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` cannot write valid kubectl configuration
- The setup.py script did not check for this dependency before attempting deployment
- The error message was buried in gcloud command output

---

## Technical Details

### The Error

```
CRITICAL: ACTION REQUIRED: gke-gcloud-auth-plugin, which is needed for
continued use of kubectl, was not found or is not executable. Install
gke-gcloud-auth-plugin for use with kubectl by following
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#install_plugin

kubeconfig entry generated for n8n-gke-cluster.
```

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

1. **No pre-flight dependency check**: setup.py only checks for `gcloud` CLI, not the plugin
2. **Silent failure**: The gcloud command returns success even when the plugin is missing
3. **kubectl context confusion**: kubectl was still pointing to a different cluster (AWS EKS), masking the issue
4. **Different from AWS/Azure**: This plugin requirement is GKE-specific and doesn't exist in EKS or AKS

###  Installation Command

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian (our environment)
sudo apt-get install -y google-cloud-cli-gke-gcloud-auth-plugin

# macOS
gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```

### Verification

```bash
# Check if plugin is installed
gke-gcloud-auth-plugin --version

# Expected output:
# Kubernetes v1.28.0 (or similar)
```

---

## Impact

### Scope
- **Severity**: High - Complete deployment failure
- **Duration**: ~30 minutes to diagnose and document
- **Resources Affected**: GKE cluster created but inaccessible via kubectl
- **Cost Impact**: Minimal - GKE cluster ran idle for ~30 minutes (~$0.05)

### What Worked
- ✅ Terraform deployment (all 26 resources)
- ✅ GCP authentication (`gcloud auth login`, `gcloud auth application-default login`)
- ✅ GCP API enablement detection (setup.py would have caught this)
- ✅ Error handling for ADC credentials (recently added in commit 6077aa4)

### What Failed
- ❌ Dependency checking for gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
- ❌ kubectl configuration
- ❌ Helm deployment
- ❌ Clear error messaging to user about missing plugin
- ❌ Automatic kubectl context switching (still pointed to AWS EKS cluster)

---

## Resolution

### Immediate Fix

1. Installed the missing plugin:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y google-cloud-cli-gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
   ```

2. Configured kubectl:
   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials n8n-gke-cluster \
     --region us-central1 --project cross-cloud-475812
   ```

3. Will manually run Helm deployment or rerun setup.py with `--skip-terraform`

### Documentation Updates (In Progress)

1. ✅ **terraform/gcp/README.md**: Added plugin requirement to Prerequisites section
2. ✅ **docs/guides/gcp-requirements.md**: Added critical warning section about plugin
3. ✅ **docs/guides/gcp-lessons-learned.md**: This document
4. ⏳ **setup.py**: Need to add dependency check (pending)

## Lessons Learned

### Key Takeaways

1. **GKE is different from EKS/AKS**:
   - EKS: Uses AWS IAM Authenticator (separate binary, but commonly included)
   - AKS: Uses Azure CLI built-in auth (no additional plugin)
   - GKE: Requires separate plugin starting with K8s 1.25+

2. **Dependency checking must be comprehensive**:
   - Don't just check for `gcloud` - check for `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` specifically
   - Version check isn't enough - verify the plugin binary exists and is executable

3. **Error messages from subprocess commands can be hidden**:
   - The setup.py script didn't surface the gcloud error clearly
   - Need better error detection in deploy_gcp_terraform function

4. **kubectl context management is critical**:
   - Having multiple clusters (AWS, Azure, GCP) requires careful context management
   - Should verify kubectl is pointing to the correct cluster before Helm deployment

5. **Platform-specific quirks need documentation**:
   - This is unique to GCP/GKE
   - Must be prominently documented in requirements
   - Should be checked programmatically

### What We'll Do Differently

#### Immediate (setup.py Code Changes)

1. **Add gke-gcloud-auth-plugin to dependency checker**:
   ```python
   GCP_TOOLS = {
       'gcloud': {
           'check_cmd': ['gcloud', 'version'],
           'description': 'Google Cloud SDK'
       },
       'gke-gcloud-auth-plugin': {
           'check_cmd': ['gke-gcloud-auth-plugin', '--version'],
           'description': 'GKE kubectl authentication plugin (REQUIRED for GKE 1.25+)'
       },
   }
   ```

2. **Add explicit check in deploy_gcp_terraform**:
   ```python
   # Before running gcloud get-credentials, verify plugin exists
   result = subprocess.run(['which', 'gke-gcloud-auth-plugin'],
                           capture_output=True, text=True)
   if result.returncode != 0:
       print(f"{Colors.FAIL}✗ gke-gcloud-auth-plugin not found{Colors.ENDC}")
       print(f"\n{Colors.WARNING}CRITICAL: This plugin is REQUIRED for kubectl authentication")
       print(f"Install with: sudo apt-get install -y google-cloud-cli-gke-gcloud-auth-plugin")
       return False
   ```

3. **Verify kubectl context after get-credentials**:
   ```python
   # Verify kubectl is pointing to the GKE cluster
   result = subprocess.run(['kubectl', 'config', 'current-context'],
                           capture_output=True, text=True)
   expected_context = f"gke_{project_id}_{region}_{cluster_name}"
   if expected_context not in result.stdout:
       print(f"{Colors.WARNING}⚠  kubectl context may not be correctly set")
   ```

4. **Better error surfacing from gcloud commands**:
   ```python
   # Capture both stdout and stderr
   # Check for "gke-gcloud-auth-plugin" in error output
   # Display formatted error message to user
   ```

#### Documentation

1. **Make plugin requirement highly visible**:
   - ✅ Added to README Prerequisites
   - ✅ Added to gcp-requirements.md with warning banner
   - ⏳ Add to getting-started guide

2. **Add troubleshooting section**:
   - Common error: "gke-gcloud-auth-plugin not found"
   - Solution steps
   - Platform-specific installation commands

3. **Create pre-deployment checklist**:
   - Verify all tools installed
   - Verify GCP authentication
   - Verify APIs enabled
   - Verify kubectl context

#### Testing

1. **Add integration test**: Deploy to GKE without plugin to verify error handling
2. **Add smoke test**: Verify plugin exists before running deployment
3. **Add context test**: Verify kubectl switches to GKE cluster correctly

## Conclusion

This incident highlights the importance of:
1. **Thorough dependency checking** beyond just the main CLI tools
2. **Cloud-specific quirks** that differ from other providers
3. **Clear error messaging** when automation fails
4. **Comprehensive documentation** of prerequisites

The resolution is straightforward (install one package), but the impact was significant (complete deployment failure). By documenting this lesson and implementing the code improvements, we'll prevent this issue for future users and make the error much clearer if it does occur.

**Key metric**: Time to diagnose (30 min) > Time to fix (1 min install). Better upfront checking would have saved this time.
