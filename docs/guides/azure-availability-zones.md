# Azure Availability Zones - PostgreSQL Flexible Server

## Summary

**Issue**: Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server availability zone support varies by region. Hardcoding `zone = "1"` causes deployment failures in regions that don't support zones (like **westus**).

**Solution**: Smart zone detection that automatically selects the appropriate configuration based on region capabilities.

---

## The Problem

### Error in westus Region

```
Error: creating Flexible Server
Status: "AvailabilityZoneNotAvailable"
Message: "Availability zone '1' isn't available in location 'westus' for subscription 'xxx'.
Choose a different availability zone."
```

### Root Cause

**Original Code (postgres.tf)**:
```hcl
resource "azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server" "main" {
  location = "westus"  # or any region
  zone     = var.postgres_high_availability ? null : "1"
  # ...
}
```

**Problem**:
- Hardcoded `zone = "1"` for single-zone deployments
- Not all Azure regions support PostgreSQL availability zones
- **westus** doesn't support zones, but **westus2**, **westus3** do

## Region Availability Zone Support

### Regions WITH Zone Support (PostgreSQL Flexible Server)

| Region | Zones | Common Use |
|--------|-------|------------|
| eastus | 1, 2, 3 | US East Coast |
| eastus2 | 1, 2, 3 | US East Coast (secondary) |
| westus2 | 1, 2, 3 | US West Coast |
| westus3 | 1, 2, 3 | US West Coast (newer) |
| centralus | 1, 2, 3 | US Central |
| northeurope | 1, 2, 3 | EU (Ireland) |
| westeurope | 1, 2, 3 | EU (Netherlands) |
| uksouth | 1, 2, 3 | UK (London) |
| southeastasia | 1, 2, 3 | Asia Pacific (Singapore) |
| japaneast | 1, 2, 3 | Asia Pacific (Tokyo) |

**Full list**: See `network.tf` lines 12-32 for complete region list.

### Regions WITHOUT Zone Support

| Region | Reason | Alternative |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| westus | Legacy region | Use westus2 or westus3 |
| southcentralus | Limited support | Use centralus |
| westcentralus | Limited support | Use westus2 |

## Solution: Smart Zone Detection

### Three-Tier Priority System

**network.tf lines 34-40**:
```hcl
locals {
  # Smart zone selection for PostgreSQL
  # Priority: user override > auto-detect based on region > null (let Azure decide)
  postgres_zone = (
    var.postgres_availability_zone != null ? var.postgres_availability_zone :
    contains(local.postgres_zone_supported_regions, var.azure_location) && !var.postgres_high_availability ? "1" :
    null
  )
}
```

**postgres.tf lines 23-27**:
```hcl
resource "azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server" "main" {
  # Smart zone selection based on region capabilities
  zone = local.postgres_zone
  # ...
}
```

### How It Works

1. **User Override** (Priority 1):
   ```bash
   # terraform.tfvars
   postgres_availability_zone = "2"  # Force zone 2
   ```
   - User explicitly sets zone
   - Used for advanced scenarios or specific requirements

2. **Auto-Detection** (Priority 2):
   ```hcl
   contains(local.postgres_zone_supported_regions, var.azure_location) && !var.postgres_high_availability ? "1" : null
   ```
   - If region supports zones AND high_availability is false → use zone "1"
   - Leverages zones for better fault isolation when available

3. **Azure Auto-Select** (Priority 3):
   ```hcl
   zone = null
   ```
   - If region doesn't support zones → null
   - Azure automatically places resource appropriately
   - Required for regions like westus

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. Cross-Region Compatibility

✅ **Works in ALL Azure regions** without manual configuration:

```bash
# Deploy to westus (no zones)
python3 setup.py --cloud-provider azure
# Location: westus → zone = null (works)

# Deploy to eastus (has zones)
python3 setup.py --cloud-provider azure
# Location: eastus → zone = "1" (better fault isolation)
```

### 2. Fault Isolation When Available

**In zone-supported regions (eastus, westus2, etc.)**:
- PostgreSQL in zone "1"
- Better isolation from zone-level failures
- Same Azure SLA (99.99% for single-zone)

**In non-zone regions (westus)**:
- Azure places resource optimally
- Still covered by Azure SLA
- No degradation in reliability

### 3. High Availability Support

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
postgres_high_availability = true
```

When HA is enabled:
- `zone = null` (required for ZoneRedundant mode)
- PostgreSQL spans multiple zones automatically
- 99.99% SLA with automatic failover

### 4. User Control

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
postgres_availability_zone = "3"  # Force specific zone
```

Advanced users can:
- Pin database to specific zone
- Match zone with application workloads
- Test zone failure scenarios

## OpenAI Recommendations (Implemented)

### Question: Best Approach for Multi-Region Deployments?

**OpenAI Answer**: Conditional logic with user override

**Our Implementation**: ✅ Three-tier priority system
- User variable for flexibility
- Auto-detection for smart defaults
- Null fallback for compatibility

### Question: Does zone = null have downsides?

**OpenAI Answer**: May miss fault isolation benefits in zone-capable regions

**Our Implementation**: ✅ Auto-detection leverages zones when available
- Uses zone "1" in supported regions
- Only uses null in non-supported regions

### Question: Best Practice for Production?

**OpenAI Answer**: Leverage zones where possible, maintain region mapping

**Our Implementation**: ✅ Comprehensive region list maintained
- 30+ zone-supported regions mapped
- Comments reference Microsoft docs
- Easy to update as Azure expands

## Performance & Cost Impact

### Performance

**Zone placement has NO performance impact**:
- Same VM instance type (sku_name)
- Same storage (storage_mb)
- Same network latency within region
- Zones are for **fault isolation**, not performance

### Cost

**Zone selection has NO direct cost impact**:
- PostgreSQL pricing based on SKU (e.g., B_Standard_B1ms)
- No additional charge for zone placement
- No zone-specific pricing tiers

**Only exception**: High availability (ZoneRedundant)
- Costs ~2x (standby replica in different zone)
- Controlled by `postgres_high_availability` variable

---

## Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Development (Let Azure Decide)

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
azure_location = "westus"
postgres_high_availability = false
# Don't set postgres_availability_zone

# Result: zone = null (Azure auto-places)
```

### Example 2: Production (Auto-Detect Zones)

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
azure_location = "eastus"
postgres_high_availability = false
# Don't set postgres_availability_zone

# Result: zone = "1" (leverages zone support)
```

### Example 3: High Availability

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
azure_location = "westus2"
postgres_high_availability = true

# Result: zone = null (required for ZoneRedundant HA)
```

### Example 4: Advanced (Pin to Specific Zone)

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
azure_location = "eastus"
postgres_availability_zone = "2"  # Force zone 2

# Result: zone = "2" (user override)
```

---

## Comparison: Before vs. After

### Before (Hardcoded Zone)

```hcl
zone = var.postgres_high_availability ? null : "1"
```

**Problems**:
- ❌ Fails in westus (no zone support)
- ❌ Fails in westcentralus
- ❌ User has no control
- ❌ Not future-proof

### After (Smart Detection)

```hcl
zone = local.postgres_zone
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Works in ALL regions
- ✅ Leverages zones when available
- ✅ User can override
- ✅ Easy to update region list
- ✅ Documented with Microsoft source

## Testing Across Regions

### Test Matrix

| Region | Zone Support | Expected Zone | Result |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| westus | ❌ No | null | ✅ Deploys |
| westus2 | ✅ Yes | "1" | ✅ Deploys with zone |
| eastus | ✅ Yes | "1" | ✅ Deploys with zone |
| centralus | ✅ Yes | "1" | ✅ Deploys with zone |

### How to Test

```bash
# Test 1: westus (no zones)
cd terraform/azure
cat > terraform.tfvars <<EOF
azure_location = "westus"
database_type = "postgresql"
EOF
terraform plan

# Expected: zone = null

# Test 2: eastus (has zones)
cat > terraform.tfvars <<EOF
azure_location = "eastus"
database_type = "postgresql"
EOF
terraform plan

# Expected: zone = "1"

# Test 3: User override
cat > terraform.tfvars <<EOF
azure_location = "eastus"
database_type = "postgresql"
postgres_availability_zone = "3"
EOF
terraform plan

# Expected: zone = "3"
```

---

## Updating Region List

As Azure expands zone support, update `network.tf`:

```hcl
locals {
  postgres_zone_supported_regions = [
    # Add new regions here
    "newregion",
    # ... existing regions
  ]
}
```

## Related Issues

### Similar Problems Across Cloud Providers

| Provider | Issue | Solution |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Azure** | westus lacks PostgreSQL zones | Smart detection (this doc) |
| **AWS** | Not all regions have 3 AZs | Similar approach needed |
| **GCP** | Zone names differ (a, b, c vs 1, 2, 3) | Separate implementation |

### AWS Comparison

AWS RDS also has regional differences:
- Some regions: 2 AZs (e.g., us-west-1)
- Most regions: 3+ AZs (e.g., us-east-1)
- Requires similar smart detection

### GCP Comparison

GCP uses letter-based zones:
- us-central1-a, us-central1-b, us-central1-c
- All Cloud SQL regions support zones
- Different problem: provider bug (see gcp-teardown-known-issue.md)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always use smart zone detection** for multi-region deployments
2. **Never hardcode zones** - breaks compatibility
3. **Maintain region list** - update as Azure expands support
4. **Provide user override** - advanced users need control
5. **Document decisions** - future maintainers will thank you
